# Bellabeat project. Data Cleaning log.

### I uploaded files to BigQuery manually, and merge the tables that have two months of information.
### In order to doing that I need to change some data types and column names. Code below: 

'''{SQL }
SELECT *
FROM `my-project-for-da-course-2.bellabeat.minuteSleep2` 
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM `my-project-for-da-course-2.bellabeat.minuteSleep`; 

SELECT * FROM `my-project-for-da-course-2.bellabeat.hourlyIntensities` 
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM `my-project-for-da-course-2.bellabeat.hourlyIntensities2`; 

SELECT 
  Id, ActivityHour,
  CAST(Calories  AS INTEGER) AS Calories
FROM
  `my-project-for-da-course-2.bellabeat.hourlyCalories2`
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM `my-project-for-da-course-2.bellabeat.hourlyCalories`;

SELECT * 
FROM `my-project-for-da-course-2.bellabeat.dailyActivity2` 
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM `my-project-for-da-course-2.bellabeat.dailyActivity`;

SELECT 
  Id AS id,
  Time AS datetime,
  Value AS value
  FROM `my-project-for-da-course-2.bellabeat.heartrate_seconds2`;

SELECT *
  FROM `my-project-for-da-course-2.bellabeat.heartrate_seconds2`
UNION ALL
SELECT *
  FROM `my-project-for-da-course-2.bellabeat.heartrate_seconds`
