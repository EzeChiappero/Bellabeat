#Bellabeat project. Data Cleaning log.

###I lost previuos SQL statements due to power breakout but long story short, I uploaded files to BigQuery manually, and merge the tables that have two months of information.
###In order to doing that I need to change some data types and column names. 

'''{SQL }
SELECT *
FROM `my-project-for-da-course-2.bellabeat.minuteSleep2` 
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM `my-project-for-da-course-2.bellabeat.minuteSleep` 
'''

'''{SQL }
SELECT * FROM `my-project-for-da-course-2.bellabeat.hourlyIntensities` 
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM `my-project-for-da-course-2.bellabeat.hourlyIntensities2` 
'''
