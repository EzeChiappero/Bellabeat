# Bellabeat
Google Data Analytics certificate project

Ask phase. The board of directores tries to know how consumers use smart devices and find any opportunity available. If we found a use case unexploided by the market we have an opportunity to impact there first.
Business task: Analyze one Bellabeat product (Amazon FitBit) to gain insights about how people use these devices.

Prepare phase. Data is uploaded to Google Cloud where I will use BigQuery to process it. There are several tables to be joined in order look for correlation between variables like heartrate, sleep quality, physical activity and calories.
Luckly, in this case it's Open data, with a CC0 license, which means public domain data.
I verified this data when I was creating tables in Google Cloud. When I uploaded the files I was creating tables with the proper data type, the proper limit in the id fields.
I'll share the code I used for merging and preparing the data.
